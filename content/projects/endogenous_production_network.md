## Project description

Recently, economists have developed models that aim at generating stylized input-output network structures endogenously. Such models are useful to understand---from a rational equilibrium point of view---how heterogeneous levels productivity across firms or industries drive stylized features of input-output networks, such as their degree distribution. In this project, we develop a computational model that emerges the nuanced topology of production networks, without the stringent assumptions of equilibrium frameworks. Instead of assuming rational firms with perfect information about their technology (production function), the market demand, and the other firms, we adopt a directed learning approach through which firms find the prices and quantities that maximize their profits. Because learning takes place through exploration and experience, the economy reaches aggregate steady states, while maintaining endogenous micro-level disequilibrium dynamics, which is consistent with real-world microdata.

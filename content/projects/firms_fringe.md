## Project description

We use network analysis and machine learning to trace and identify clusters of companies that specialize in fringe behaviour. 
Trends in firm ownership are used to identify mechanisms for obscuring the beneficial owner of companies. 
The project may provide policymakers with guidance on how company ownership evolves over time as clusters that specialize in fringe behaviour learn and adapt to government enforcement mechanisms.

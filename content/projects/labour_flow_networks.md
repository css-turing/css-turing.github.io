## Project description

We develop agent-computing models describing the movement of individuals within the labour market that emerges realistic patterns of job-to-job transitions. Taken collectively, these job-to-job transitions constitute a labour flown network (LFN) where nodes contain pools of jobs with shared characteristics (e.g. they are within the same industry, geographical region, etc.) and edges between nodes represent job-to-job movements.

This model can be leveraged to explore scenarios related to the future of work, including the transition to net zero and the increased useage of AI and automation within certain jobs.

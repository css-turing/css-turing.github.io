## Project description

Technological sophistication drives economic growth and diversification.
We develop methods to quantify the degree of sophistication of entire industries and to understand how various inputs come together in a production process to generate novel outputs.
Our tools build on recent advances in information theory and machine learning, and provides policymakers with insights to make strategic decisions when promoting investments in specific industries.

## Project description

An understanding of the ways skills interact with each other to influence career trajectories of individuals, and the productivity of occupations is key to developing labour market policies (e.g. upskilling programs). Leveraging rich microdata covering multiple countries and novel techniques developed within the computational social science group, this project explores how workplace skills interact with each other to impact outcomes at the micro- and macro-level, as well as their evolution through the labour market.

## Project description

In major cities around the world, housing markets are in the eye of public opinion; not only because of their economic importance, but also due to the recent growth of inequality.
The analysis of these complex systems demand tools that can handle large-scale data, heterogeneous agents and institutions, spatial features, agent-level economic behaviour and interaction, etc.
This project develops models and tools to study various phenomena related to housing markets such as endogenous inequality, spatial impacts from changes in infrastructure, affordability, ownership-rental flows, among others.
Our tools provide researchers and policymakers to perform nuanced counterfactual analyses that can exploit newly available property, economic, and demographic datasets.

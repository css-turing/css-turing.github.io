## Project description

International trade is a complex economic problem.
New trade data and computational modelling techniques allow us to develop new types of models that account for nuances and dynamics that standard economic models cannot.
Our models enable trade analysists and policymakers to gain deep insight into the potential outcomes of policies such as creating new trade agreements.

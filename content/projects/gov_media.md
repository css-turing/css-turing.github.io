## Project description

The relationship between government and media is often complicated, and highly dependent on institutional context.
Emerging large-scale data such as news content and open government spending datasets provides us with new information to understand this relationship.
In this project, we combine this type of information with machine learning and econometrics to disentangle the various nuances of how the media influences policymaking and how policymakers influence the media. 
The project identifies novel evidence that sheds new light on this problem, and that can be used to design better regulatory frameworks when aiming to safeguard democracy and free press.

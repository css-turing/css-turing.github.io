## Project description

We develop models of endogenous technology which centres skill-based worker sorting in its operation. 
These tools allow us to understand how individuals with various degrees of specialisation and ability end up together in certain industries and firms, giving place to various degrees of firm productivity.
Our models can be easily used with standard labour force surveys and provide a framework to assess the impact skill complementarities in productivity.

## About me

 I am the Head of Computational Social Science Research of The Alan Turing Institute. I also have the pleasure of leading this group of talented the CSS scholars at the Turing. I am an economist with a PhD in Computational Social Science (CSS) from George Mason University. Previously, I worked at the Department of Economics of University College London and, before that, at Oxford University, in the Sa√Ød Business School and in the Institute for New Economic Thinking. I do research on different aspects of CSS, including methodology, large-scale data analysis, and different modelling flavours. I also enjoy translating this research into useful tools to help solving problems of public interest, leading me to work with various governments and international organisations. At the moment, I am working on topics related to labour mobility, sustainable development, public administration, technological change, housing markets, and wealth inequality.

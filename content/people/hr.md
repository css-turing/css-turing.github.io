## About me

Hardik Rajpal is a postdoctoral research associate with the computational social sciences group in the public policy programme at the Alan Turing Institute. He is also associated with the Centre for Complexity Science at the Imperial College London, where he finished his PhD in Applied Mathematics on the study of causality and emergence in complex systems.

His work focuses on using mathematical modelling, information theory and network science to investigate various complex systems ranging from social-media, production economies, ecolosystems and the brain. His current work focuses on bringing the tools from information theory to computational social sciences in order to assist with relavant policy questions. Most recently this approach enabled quantifying technological foundations of economic complexity. On similar lines, another project focuses on exploring the interdependencies among skills in the workplace. Concurrently, he is engagged with a project to study the statistical physics of cognition at Imperial College London.

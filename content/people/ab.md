As a computational social scientist, he uses machine learning and natural language processing to generate quantitative measures of often unmeasurable phenomena from text in Spanish. Alejandro completed his undergraduate studies in Public Policy at the Universidad Aut√≥noma de Sinaloa. Prior to joining the Alan Turing Institute, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Government and Public Policy at the University of Arizona where he developed tools for tracking migrant caravans and gangs across Central America using local newspapers.

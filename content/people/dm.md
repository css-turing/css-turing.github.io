## About me

David Meine is working with the CSS Group on an Agent-Based Model of the Labour Market. Apart from that, he is a PhD Student at the Centre for Complexity Science at Imperial College and a Co-Founder of StartIn, a platform that helps students form Start-Ups. He also works for Ridgeway Information, advising the IAEA on how to improve workflows with the responsible use of AI.

David has degrees in Physics and Economics from the University of Hamburg and the Humboldt-University of Berlin and is now working on models that combine both disciplines. Before the start of his PhD, he was an Academic Visitor at Imperial College for a year. 

His research is mostly focussed on Agent-Based Models and what they can tell us about the structure of markets. Projects that he has worked on include Neuron-Based Models of opinion in financial markets, as well as Agent-Based Models of hierarchies in markets studying the emergence of speculation and crashes.

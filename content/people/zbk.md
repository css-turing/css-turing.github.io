## About me

Zachary Kessler is a postdoctoral research associate with the computational social science group in the Public Policy programme at the Alan Turing Institute. Prior to joining the group, he completed his PhD in Economics at George Mason University where he studied computational methods that can simulate institutional processes

His research broadly focuses on the use of the computational and econometric methods paired with modern data-driven technologies to explore a variety of micro and macro level economic phenomena. He has particular interest work involving productivity, technology, inequality, housing, cities, and institutions. Recently, he has worked alongside colleagues to develop models that estimate skill heterogeneity and complementarityâ€™s impact on productivity as well as simulations of housing market dynamics that simultaneously recreate both geographic prices and rental rates.
